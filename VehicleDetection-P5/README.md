# Vehicle Detection

In this project, the goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video.

The steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images
* Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color of resized image, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Normalize the features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Train a Linear SVM classifier
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run the pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

Here are links to the labeled data for [vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip) and [non-vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip) examples to train your classifier.  These example images come from a combination of the [GTI vehicle image database](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html), the [KITTI vision benchmark suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/), and examples extracted from the project video itself.
